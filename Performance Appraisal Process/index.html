        <h1>Archived: Performance Appraisal Static Demo</h1>
        <p>
            This static HTML demo has been archived and cleared from the
            repository to avoid confusion with the dynamic application codebase.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need the original demo content, it is available in the
            project history. The application now relies on database migrations
            and seeders for test data.
